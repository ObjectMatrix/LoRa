## LoRa: Symbol Generation. 
LoRa is a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation based wireless networking standard
Chirp stands for **Compressed High Intensity Radar Pulse.** It is a signal which frequency either increase or decrease with time. It is very common is sonar and radar. It is also used in spread spectrum.  

+ CSS techniques helps to transmit signals for very large distances.   
+ Bandwidth, time product is always greater than one (B*T > 1).  
+ CSS is resistive to Doppler shift. 
+ It is used for low power and low data rates.
